# Parrot Refactoring Kata Java version
====================================

Parrot Refactoring Kata.

Can you spot any code smells in this code? I'll give you a clue - a spot of Pol(l)ymorphism should improve matters!
Refactor this code, take small steps, run the tests often. See how small and beautiful you can make it.

The project uses:
 - Maven [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
 - Junit 5 [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)

## Acknowlegements
This code is heavily inspired by one of the examples in Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring".
It's a classic, and if it's not on your bookshelf already I suggest you treat yourself to a copy!
